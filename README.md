# THIS IS NOT FINISHED

# What is this?

This repo is using the template of Psych Engine 0.5.2h with Kade Engine 1.5.3 Input

There is some stuff that I want to do like: accessing system storage for mods and that stuff but that might take me more time than the base port

I added Android controls to this which are the ones used on [FNF-PE-0.3.2h](https://github.com/SanicBTW/FNF-PE-0.3.2h)

Thanks to MAJigsaw for the [Android controls](https://github.com/MAJigsaw77/FNF-Android-Porting)
